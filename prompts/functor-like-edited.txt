I am doing some functional programming like type of programming.
I am using typescript, I am creating tools using classes.
Iwill use them as functional programming constructs...
So far I am aware of the concept of a functor or such...
The concept of having a map/flatmap to tranform an internal value.
Except that... something is missing something is not useful...
Because if you can not: a. put into an b. get out of the value...
I needed a construct taht can act as a box similar to the functir.
I created my own «boxing» element that can inbox and unbox.
I have not the knowledge of wordings, naming or appelataions.
Actual terms used in academic real, pure functional programming...
Maybe something in true functional programming taht I am unaware of.
Nonetheless I am creating the stuff I need to accomplish the task.
I need to accomplished my goals regardless if the tools exist already.
Regardless of the academic soundness of what I am doing...
It is more important to me to focus on the actual functionality.
Or lets say usefulness to avoid confusion when using «functionality».
I have therefor created some type (a class) that can get value inside.
Also it can get value ot of itbecaus it is what is usefull to me.
So it can place some value in it (the container) and get value out.
At this stage it's not a functor yet, as it does not have a map/flatmap.
It will later get such capability by inheritance or extension or such.

For me this is a recurring theme since forever I have been doing this.
Again and again, in what I am doing, in multiple different shapes.
In different projects, with different goals, different purposes.
Today I have decide it was time to find out the true nature of that.
Today I will need to discover the true nature of what I am doing.
Because I am looking at to concepts I am dealing with and I wonder...
For so long contemplating all I did and all what I am doing...
And today I realist that I do not know how to name theses concepts...

I have created my own personal paradigms based on my needs.
But maybe and those patterns perhaps already exist or perhaps not.
Maybe they are completely new to man kind or well known concepts.
Regardless either way I need to know the appellation of such concepts.
Maybe names already exists or maybe name will have to be created.

So I am asking you to help me find the peace of mind I am looking for.
Tell me... For such concept... Something like a class or an object...
Some sort of a construct, the concrete concept or the abstract one.
Maybe as far as the «meta» concept, one of similar nature if anything.
Even something that beyonf the topic at hand woud exist conceptually.

As an analogy would help you fid out the patern and the shape behind:
It is all about something that can ingest a value lets use an image...
Imagine someone eat food, ingest it, this would be the first phase.
Then imagine digestion would be the mapping phase the transform.
Lastly imagine that excretion, you guessed it, would be the unboxing.
The generalize it to any such concept. Then think more specifically,
really for the moment think specifically about my programming concept.
This so called construct, I need to understand what to name all parts.

I think you can help me understand existing conventions, help me...
Help me create also, new conventions and new concepts out of it.
Explain me if the concepts already exist because it is unclear to me.
I mean at least from what I said we know that mapping is the functor.
I need to understand it (if it already exists) or create it.
I need to know, or I need to invent: Names, appellation, descriptions.

For each of those 3 concept separated, in isolation...
Or all together in a same class or togeter 2 by two in tandem...
those things that are about, in a first part:
inboxing, lifting, ingesting, boxing or such as the 1st concept...
then in a second part those things that are about:
mapping, map, flatmap, transform, functor or such as 2nd concept...
Lastly then in the third part those things that are about:
unboxing, excreting, getting out of and such as the 3rd concept...

Can you, from TypeScript perpective extending to computer science,
in the context of a tool, a class, an object, any type of construct.
can you please:
A) Summarize all that I have said... crafting a comprehensive summary.
B) Extracting from what I said the concepts that exist already or not.
C) Extract each of the question I am asking about those concepts.
D) drafting elements of answers based on your knowledge and dataset.
extanding to include common knowledge and well know best practices.
E) Expanding from the known concepts and from the unknown elements,
in a creative manner, with te objective to create new ideas
ideas that extend from the already well know ideas, extending from
what you understand about what I am explaining...
Using a creative and novel appraoch, describe my concept in ways that
would be useful for my work.
F) finally please sum up all that was said in a, b, c, d, and e...
Outline (list) the key elements surrounding theses 3 main concept.
Listing names and words that could act as synonyms or remplacement of
well known appellations both those you would already have mentioned
and reiterating them now but also others that you would add to list
even more options that would be usefull to name these concept.
