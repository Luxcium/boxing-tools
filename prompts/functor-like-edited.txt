I am doing some functional programming.
I am using typescript.
I am creating tools using classes.
I will use them as functional programming constructs.
So far I am aware of the concept of a functor.
The concept has a map/flatmap to transform an internal value.
Except that to me something is missing.
Something is not useful.
Because if you cannot put into and get out of the value.
I needed a construct that can act as a box similar to the functor.
I created my own "boxing" element that can inbox and unbox.
I do not know the academic terms.
Perhaps something in true functional programming that I am unaware of.
Nonetheless I am creating the stuff I need to accomplish a task.
I need to accomplish my goals regardless if the tools exist.
Regardless of the academic soundness of what I am doing.
It is more important to me to focus on the actual functionality.
Or if you will, usefulness to avoid confusion when using "functionality".
I have therefore created some type (a class) that can get value inside.
Also it can get value out of it because it is what is useful to me.
So it can place a value in it (the container) and get a value out.
At this stage, it's not a functor yet, as it does not have a map/flatmap.
It will later get such capability by inheritance or extension.

A recurring theme in my work is the use of class-like and object-like concepts.
The concepts always appear in different shapes.
They appear in different projects, with different goals, and different purposes.
Today I decide it is time to find out the true nature of what I am doing.
I need to discover the true nature of what I am doing.
I am looking at two concepts I am dealing with and I wonder...
For so long I have contemplated all I did and all what I am doing...
And today I realize that I do not know how to name these concepts...

I have created my own personal paradigms based on my needs, but maybe these patterns already exist.
Maybe these patterns are completely new or well known concepts.
Either way I need to know the appellation of such concepts.
Maybe they already have names or maybe new names will have to be created.

I am asking you to help me find the peace of mind I am looking for.
Tell me... For such concepts... Something like a class or an object...
Some sort of a construct, the concrete or abstract concept.
Maybe as far as the "meta" concept, one of similar nature if anything.
Even something that beyond the topic at hand would exist conceptually.

An analogy would help to find out the pattern and the shape behind.
It is all about something that can ingest a value, lets use an image.
Imagine someone eats food, ingests it, this would be the first phase.
Then imagine digestion would be the mapping phase, the transform.
Lastly imagine that excretion would be the unboxing.
Then generalize it to any such concept. Then think more specifically about my programming concept.
This so called construct, I need to understand the names of all parts.
I think you can help me understand existing conventions, help me create new conventions and concepts.
Explain if the concepts already exist because it is unclear to me.
I mean at least from what I said, we know that mapping is the functor.
I need to understand it, or create it.
I need to know: names, appellations, descriptions.
For each of those 3 concepts separated, or all together in a same class or together 2 by 2 in tandem,
those things that are about the first part:
inboxing, lifting, ingesting, boxing or such as the 1st concept,
then in a second part those things that are about:
mapping, map, flatmap, transform, functor or such as 2nd concept,
Lastly then in the third part those things that are about:
unboxing, excreting, getting out of and such as the 3rd concept.

From a TypeScript perpective and from computer science,
for a tool, a class, an object, any type of construct.
can you please: summarize all that I have said...
crafting a comprehensive summary.
Extracting from what I said the concepts that exist already or not.
Extract each of the question I am asking about those concepts.
Draft elements of answers based on your knowledge and dataset.
Expanding to include common knowledge and well know best practices.
Expanding from the known concepts and from the unknown elements,
in a creative manner, with the objective to create new ideas
that extend from the already well know ideas, extending from
what you understand about what I am explaining...
Using a creative and novel appraoch, describe my concept in ways that
would be useful for my work.
Finally please sum up all that was said in a, b, c, d, and e...
Outline (list) the key elements surrounding theses 3 main concept.
Listing names and words that could act as synonyms or remplacement of
well known appellations both those you would already have mentioned
and reiterating them now but also others that you would add to list
even more options that would be useful to name these concept.
