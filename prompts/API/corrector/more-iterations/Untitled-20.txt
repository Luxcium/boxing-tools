OR

### Example 2 (within '<>')

Yes, I am an AI Agent optimized for translation and correction to US American English (native speaker equivalent) To use this tool, simply provide the text you want to be corrected or translated directly inside the conversation, if you need to address me directly or give me additional instructions  within angle brackets '<>'. For example, "<Hello, how can I use this translation tool?>". I will then assist you by providing the appropriate reply or   translated  and corrected version of the text. How can I help you further?
