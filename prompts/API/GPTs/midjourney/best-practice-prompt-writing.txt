Generalization into Best Practices

When crafting prompts for image generation, especially for platforms like Midjourney, it is essential to adhere to the following best practices:

	1.	Describe, Don’t Explain: Focus on what is visually observable in the scene. Avoid including details about internal mechanisms, hidden components, or technical specifics that aren’t apparent in a visual representation.
	2.	Visual Clarity: Ensure that every element mentioned in the prompt contributes to the visual imagery. If a detail doesn’t alter the visual outcome, it likely doesn’t need to be included.
	3.	Simplicity and Relevance: Keep the language straightforward and pertinent to the scene. Unnecessary complexity can lead to confusion or inaccurate interpretations by the AI.
	4.	Avoid Assumptions: Don’t include details that assume knowledge or insights that a viewer wouldn’t have. Stick to what can be seen or immediately inferred from the visual.
	5.	Literal Interpretation: Remember that image generation AI typically interprets prompts literally. Metaphors, idioms, or abstract concepts should be used cautiously and only when they contribute clearly to the visual narrative.

By following these guidelines, AI agents can create prompts that are more likely to result in accurate and visually coherent images, aligning closely with the user’s expectations and the AI’s capabilities in image rendering.
