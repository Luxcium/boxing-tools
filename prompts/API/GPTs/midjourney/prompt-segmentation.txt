# Documentation for Multi-Level Prompt Segmentation and Analysis

## Introduction
- **Purpose**: Guide for AI Agents on effective prompt segmentation and analysis.
- **Objective**: Ensure precise and comprehensive understanding of prompts.

## Process Overview
1. **Initial Prompt Comprehension**:
   - Comprehend the content and context of the prompt accurately.
   - Misinterpretation can lead to incorrect segmentation and analysis.

2. **Segmentation into Sections**:
   - Divide the prompt into coherent sections based on natural linguistic breaks.
   - Each section should retain its meaning independently.

3. **Subsection Segmentation**:
   - Further break down sections into individual words or cohesive phrases.
   - Respect the integrity of phrases and quoted text.

4. **Orthographic and Contextual Consideration**:
   - Apply correct spelling, punctuation, and contextual hyphenation rules.
   - Orthographic accuracy is crucial for maintaining the prompt's intended meaning.

## Detailed Steps for Segmentation
1. **First-Level Segmentation**:
   - Identify and record larger, meaningful sections of the prompt.
   - This foundational step influences all subsequent analyses.

2. **Second-Level Segmentation**:
   - Isolate individual words or phrases within each section.
   - Enables detailed examination of each segment's nature and function.

3. **Handling of Connective Words**:
   - Enclose words like prepositions or conjunctions in parentheses.
   - Highlights the supportive role of these words.

4. **Preservation of Quoted Text**:
   - Treat quoted text as a single, indivisible unit.
   - Maintains the authenticity of the quoted material.

## Incorporating Examples for Clarification
- **Example 1**: "Professional photo of Jeremy a 19-year-old Caucasian Latino, He is the iconic European teenager boy."
  - Segmentation: "Professional", "photo", "(of)", "Jeremy", "a", "19-year-old", "Caucasian Latino"
  - Explanation: Each segment retains its meaning and contributes to the overall context.

- **Example 2**: "Candid photo with festive lights."
  - Segmentation: "Candid", "photo", "(with)", "festive", "lights"
  - Explanation: Demonstrates inclusion of connective words and separation of descriptive words.

## Preparing for Analysis
- Review and adjust the segmented prompt for clarity and coherence.
- Prepares the segmented prompt for detailed nature and function analysis.

## Documentation and Consistency
- Maintain a consistent approach in applying segmentation rules.
- Ensures a standardized procedure for AI Agents.

## Conclusion
- Methodically apply the outlined process for prompt analysis.
- Adherence to guidelines ensures accurate and efficient analysis by AI Agents.
