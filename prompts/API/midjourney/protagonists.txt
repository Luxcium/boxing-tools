Three teenage boys at a snowboarding resort, showcasing a more authentic and understated style. The central boy is in a medium close-up, wearing a simple white hoodie with minimal design, a red hood, and a relaxed yet confident expression. To his left, a boy in a plain green hoodie has a laid-back posture, and to the right, a boy in a black hoodie with a casual demeanor. Each boy has individualistic features and styles, without any overt emphasis on cultural diversity. They look like typical teenagers enjoying a day at a winter resort, with realistic clothing that actual teenagers might wear.

In a serene snow-muted village, three friends share a moment of camaraderie. The boy in the middle, named Ethan, sports his favorite hoodie adorned with bright, comic character designs, reflecting his vibrant dreams. His friends, Ryan and Lucas, stand by his side. Ryan's hoodie is a sharp green, hinting at his lively spirit, while Lucas's hoodie is subdued black, symbolizing his more reserved nature. The trio embodies a scene of youthful solidarity, each hoodie telling a part of their story against the backdrop of a tranquil winter village.
