but if instead I want to have a tuner for Â«photo of a teencore boy with green eyesÂ» (https://tuner.midjourney.com/crXll1H)  it is good because this would not be the same and it would be ok to do a new one ? It would also be ok also to do one for Â«photo of a teencore boy with green hoodieÂ» (https://tuner.midjourney.com/qE1T48O)  because it is not the same thing that has to be green but would be waistful to do something like Â«photo of a teencore boy wearing orange hoodieÂ» (https://tuner.midjourney.com/aFPgN5y) because in my specific case Blue Red or Green is similar enough... but for red eyes (which is not a natural eye colour compare to green) it would then be more useful to get one (which I did not do as of the writing of this message)...

if you read my previous message it was obvious that I was about to make the red eyes tuner ðŸ˜…  there it is: Â«photo of a teencore boy with red eyesÂ» (https://tuner.midjourney.com/P4i81I1)

so ok to recap... if I am interested in doing a tuner like Â«cinematic photo of a teencore boy wearing a hoodieÂ» (https://tuner.midjourney.com/6maCqu6) and then also one like Â«candid photo of a teencore boy wearing a hoodieÂ» (https://tuner.midjourney.com/X0Es2Tp) it would be because I do not really understand the thing and would be wasting my minutes but not as much as if I would have also made one for lets say something like Â«webcam photo of a teencore boy wearing a hoodieÂ» (https://tuner.midjourney.com/OWnf9Iy) because **Â«these prompts are semantically similarÂ»**
