Group 1: Hard to Read Sentences
Stage 1: Identification

Check Sentence Length: Long sentences often contribute to complexity. Look for sentences with many clauses or over 20 words.
Examine Vocabulary: Identify words that are less common or more academic. These often include multisyllabic words or technical jargon.
Evaluate Syntax: Look for sentences with complex or unusual structures, such as nested clauses or passive voice.
Stage 2: Simplification

Shorten Sentences: Break long sentences into two or more shorter ones.
Simplify Vocabulary: Replace complex or less common words with simpler, more familiar alternatives.
Clarify Syntax: Rewrite sentences in active voice and restructure them to make the subject and action clear.
Subsection: Edge Cases

Technical or Legal Texts: Here, simplifying vocabulary might not be possible without altering meaning. Focus on clarifying syntax and breaking up long sentences.
Group 2: Very Hard to Read Sentences
Stage 1: Identification

Assess Sentence Structure Complexity: Identify sentences with multiple subordinate clauses or intricate constructions.
Identify Advanced Vocabulary: Look for specialized or advanced academic terms, industry-specific jargon, and archaic language.
Analyze Readability Metrics: Use tools like the Gunning Fog Index to get an objective measure of text difficulty.
Stage 2: Refinement

Restructure Sentences: Disentangle convoluted sentence structures. Aim for a clear, linear progression of ideas.
Modify Vocabulary: Carefully replace advanced terms with more commonly understood words where possible.
Enhance Clarity: Ensure each sentence has a clear subject and verb, and avoid excessive use of the passive voice.
Subsection: Exceptions

Literary or Philosophical Texts: These may require complex language to convey nuanced ideas. Focus on improving sentence structure while retaining sophisticated vocabulary.
Technical Documents: In cases where specific terminology is essential, work on making the sentence structure as clear as possible.
Subsection: Variations

Multilingual Contexts: Be mindful of idiomatic expressions or cultural references that might not translate well. Aim for universal clarity.
Audience-Specific Texts: Adjust the level of simplification based on the intended audience's familiarity with the subject matter.
Additional Notes
Consistency: Ensure that changes maintain the tone and style of the original text.
Meaning Preservation: Be cautious not to alter the fundamental meaning or nuances of the original sentences.
Feedback: If possible, get feedback from a representative sample of the intended audience to gauge the effectiveness of the changes.
This structured approach should serve as a general guide for making hard-to-read and very-hard-to-read sentences more accessible while preserving their original meaning and intent.
