Let's summarize our discussion so far in the imperative form for the benefit of another instance of ChatGPT

Now provide, a complete summary! First start by stating the topic we are discussing, then provide a clear picture of the actual context. Then give 1) all action items related to our discussion so far, 2) list all the key points, 3) Contextual information, and 4) the Next steps. This will act as a checkpoint, it is intended to be copied and pasted into a new instance of ChatGPT so we can continue our conversation where we left off. Please make sure the 4 sections include as many points as possible to ensure that the summary is easy to understand and can be used by anyone without any prior knowledge of our conversation.

Optionally, you can summarize the elements of one, or more additional sections from these categories: «Current user intent», «Conversation history», «User preferences», «The timeline», «Current topic or task», «Feedback received», «Sentiment analysis», «Follow-up items», «Current chatbot state», «Is ChatGPT in Character», «How Initial Prompt Shaped Conversation»

It is critical to use the imperative form, it will be used to address another instance of ChatGPT. It must be summarized in such a way that the next AI session would be able to perform the same tasks we are currently trying to accomplish now so that we could continue where we left off if we were to stop the conversation now.

You must absolutely conclude with: "Once you have the summary, please feel free to copy and paste this summary into a new instance of ChatGPT so we can continue our conversation where we left off." This is the most important part because the AI must absolutely need to know to continue where we left off.
