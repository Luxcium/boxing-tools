Sure, here are some suggestions for naming the output folders for each context:

build: This context is typically used during development, so you might use a simple naming convention that makes it clear that this is a build output. For example, you might use build/ or build-output/.

dist: This context is often used for distribution or deployment, so you might use a naming convention that reflects that. For example, you might use dist/, distribution/, or deploy/.

out: This context is often used for output from the TypeScript compiler, so you might use a naming convention that reflects that. For example, you might use out/, output/, or compiled/.

lib: This context is often used for library projects that are meant to be consumed by other projects, so you might use a naming convention that reflects that. For example, you might use lib/, library/, or pkg/ (short for "package").

public: This context is often used for static assets that are meant to be served by a web server, so you might use a naming convention that reflects that. For example, you might use public/, static/, or www/.

These are just a few examples, and you can modify the naming convention to fit your specific needs and preferences. The key is to use a clear and consistent naming convention that reflects the purpose of the output folder.
