Certainly! When discussing the same concept informally in private settings, people often use more colloquial language. Here are ten informal phrases that might be used:

"Package": A common, somewhat playful term.
"Bulge": A straightforward, colloquial term.
"Goods": A humorous, euphemistic phrase.
"Junk": Slang, often used humorously or casually.
"Crotch area": Direct, yet still somewhat discreet.
"Front bump": A softer, less direct term.
"Manhood area": A bit more evocative but still within the bounds of casual conversation.
"Privates' outline": A bit more specific, referring to the visible shape.
"Basket": A term sometimes used, particularly in fashion contexts.
"Family jewels' display": A playful, euphemistic term.
In the context of ballet dancers, the prominent shape is often more noticeable due to the tight-fitting nature of ballet attire. Ballet dancers typically wear what's known as a "dance belt," which is a type of specialized undergarment similar to a thong. The dance belt serves several purposes:

Support and Protection: It provides support and protection for the male genitalia during strenuous and acrobatic movements.
Aesthetic Appeal: Ballet focuses heavily on aesthetics and lines. The dance belt helps create a smooth, clean line, which is aesthetically pleasing and less distracting.
Comfort: It offers comfort during the extensive range of motion required in ballet.
The prominence of this area in ballet dancers is not due to any physical difference but rather the result of the dance belt's design and the need for it in the physically demanding and visually meticulous art of ballet. The tightness and support it provides can accentuate the area, particularly when combined with the fitted nature of ballet attire.

"Frontal contour": This term is anatomically descriptive without being explicit, making it suitable for a general audience.

"Pronounced silhouette": This phrase subtly hints at the shape without focusing too much on specifics.

"Noticeable outline": Similar to 'pronounced silhouette', this term is descriptive without being too direct.

"Distinctive front profile": This phrase maintains professionalism while clearly indicating the area of focus.

"Enhanced frontal area": This term suggests the prominence of the area without being crude.

"Visible bulge": While slightly more direct, it's still neutral and avoids being offensive.

"Evident front shape": This phrase is clear yet maintains a respectful tone.

"Outlined front section": This focuses on the outline created by the clothing, which is a tactful way to address the topic.

"Apparent frontal protrusion": A more technical term that avoids casual or slang connotations.

"Marked front region": This is another way of indicating the area without being explicit.
