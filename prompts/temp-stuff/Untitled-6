I have a quick question, do you know if any moderators would be more susceptible to be willing to help me that other I have a problem and I would like to see if I can get it resolved without getting into more problems
I realize that the rules are very strict and I think that it could be argue that something was not carrying the intention that have been characterized... I guess that trying to discuss the situation with some can lead them to agree with me or other to decide to characterize the situation with an even stricter view on the problem... I do not want to get into trouble and I feel that what happened (the thing I would like to discuss with someone capable of discernement) is not like it was determined it is...
