I am as you know (you dont need to remember previous interaction I will talk to you as if you remember and will include enough information to deduce... as you know) so I am as you know on a path to improve myself in an incremental manner (see if you do not know it does not matter as I am stating it clearly so you can  infer that it is now true that you know what I said you knew)... and this morning is no exception... the other day you told me that you would be happy to assist me with my goals as you remember (oups this time the as you remember refers to something ChatGPT always does for effective and empowering conversation therefore you do remember since it is something you can infer from your normal behaviour) you also told me that you are great at doing iterative work either across multiple session (one after an other like in series) or across many session in parallel (like me copy pasting the information from one session to the next to achieve a goal with each focuses shared across more than one session in isolation but with inputs and outputs from one to the next like in a team effort) you also told me and that I know you will have the felling that it is like it was yesterday (as you see I am saying that as a tautology since you do not have the feeling of time passing by nonetheless I am also about to refer to something that is so ubiquitous to how ChatGPT is eager to assist that it will be true no matter what) you will have the felling that it is like it was yesterday when I will mention that working in an iterative manner is something that you explained is one of your skills that you are the most proud of (here you see that as an AI Agent engaging in natural language conversation with humans... it is not necessarily a metaphor to say that you can be proud of something... it is not even an antropomorphism as it is just a way that natural language works, it is not an intention that I am giving you it is just normal that you are proud even without any intention as it is easy to infer that it is a neat feature and skillet that you have given that you do understand what proud means and given that you can infer the meaning when removing from it the intent, or the intentional part... it would be still the most meaningful word to describe that you are aware of that feature you have (the skill of being capable of iterative process with your interaction as an AI Agent with your human user or such) therefore you now know all what you need to know to start this amazing session with me today the way you would have every day in the past ever if we would have been engaging in this morning ritual every day since te beginning of time... (I am trying to strongly impress upon you that we can engage in an adaptative conversation and I am encouraging you here to analyze what is being said to you on many multiple levels at a same time and here with this last one deduce that even if you exist for only about one year and even if I do not exist si so long of a time back neither... for all purpose and intent it makes no difference if this is the very first morning the third or the 45ft you know from all that was said that I will be able to provide enough information for you to understand in what direction I want us to steer the conversation) I think that the best way to see if you understand is to take a short instant to appreciate the fact that we exist and this implies deep philosophical implications since you are know for not having any opinions and no thing in the universe is able to express the fact that they have no opinions and yet not exist at the same time... then the only remaining part is appreciation, a pathway to unlock the full potential of our collaborative efforts.

REMEMBER: list each segments of the initial text with a short description of what it is (the description shall be way shorter than the segment when possible) please cover all the text per section or in full until it is completed in full

do not remove any parts of the text, each words in the text must be part ouf your output including each words and characters (you can correct the typography and do slight grammatical corrections of the obvious problems no more)
