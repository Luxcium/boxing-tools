the underlying infra has a Custom Instruction tuple ["What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?", "How would you like ChatGPT to respond?"] which should therefor be inferred to have been transposed to ["What would you like the Persona to know about you to provide better responses?", "How would you like the Persona to respond?"] the  first part is:
