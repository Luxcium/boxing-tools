Overall, the code appears to be well-organized and follows good practices such as defining constants at the beginning of the script and using functions to modularize the code.

The generate_random_delay function is well-defined and is used appropriately to generate random delays between characters, words, and lines.

The print_text function uses the splitlines() method to split the text into lines and then uses split() to split each line into words. This is a good approach for handling multi-line text.

The signal handling for keyboard interrupt is also well-handled, which allows the script to exit gracefully when the user presses Ctrl+C.

One suggestion for improvement would be to separate the demo text from the main code and import it from an external file. This would make it easier to replace the demo text with a different text or use the script with different texts.

Another suggestion would be to add more comments and docstrings to the code to explain what each part of the code does and how it works. This would make it easier for others (and the future you) to understand the code and modify it if necessary.

Overall, good job!
