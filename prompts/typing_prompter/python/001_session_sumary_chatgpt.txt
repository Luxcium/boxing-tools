Topic: Philosophical reflection, Python programming

Context: We have been discussing the creation of a Python script to display a philosophical text character by character with random delays between characters, words, and lines.

Action Items:

Set constants for average words per minute and average characters per word
Calculate time per word and time per character
Define delay times for characters, words, and lines
Modify generate_random_delay and display_text_char_by_char functions
Define print_char, print_word, print_line, and print_text functions
Modify print_text function to print the entire text with random delays between lines
Set the terminal in raw mode
Define the main function of the script
Handle keyboard interrupt
Key Points:

Use constants to determine time per word and time per character
Define unique random delay time for each character, word, and line
Print each character, word, and line with random delays between them
Use signal library to handle keyboard interrupt
Set the terminal in raw mode to disable buffering of input characters
Contextual Information:

We have been discussing the creation of a Python script to display a philosophical text character by character with random delays between characters, words, and lines.
We have set constants for average words per minute and average characters per word and calculated time per word and time per character.
We have defined delay times for characters, words, and lines and modified the generate_random_delay and display_text_char_by_char functions.
We have also defined the print_char, print_word, print_line, and print_text functions and modified the print_text function to print the entire text with random delays between lines.
We have set the terminal in raw mode and defined the main function of the script and handle keyboard interrupt.
Next Steps:

Review the code to ensure best practices are followed
Test the script to ensure it works as expected
Consider modifying the script to read a user inputted text instead of the hardcoded demo text
