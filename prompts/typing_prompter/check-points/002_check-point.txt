Sure, I'd be happy to summarize what we've accomplished so far.

You wanted to create a script that simulates a typing prompter with randomized delays between each character, word, and line. The script was to have three files: main.sh, settings.sh, and functions.sh.

The settings.sh file contains the following variables:

demo_text: contains the text to be displayed
char_min_delay: the minimum delay between characters
char_max_delay: the maximum delay between characters
word_min_delay: the minimum delay between words
word_max_delay: the maximum delay between words
line_min_delay: the minimum delay between lines
line_max_delay: the maximum delay between lines
The main.sh file contains the following functions:

print_char: prints a single character with a random delay
print_word: prints a single word with random delays between characters
print_line: prints a single line with random delays between words
print_text: prints the entire text with random delays between lines
The functions.sh file contains the following function:

generate_random_delay: generates a random delay time between two values
The main.sh file sources the settings.sh file and the functions.sh file, and calls the print_text function with the demo_text as an argument. This simulates the typing prompter with randomized delays between each character, word, and line.

This is a detailed summary of what we have accomplished so far.


##______________________________________________________________________________

Here's a summary of what was accomplished so far:

The original script was a basic implementation of a typing prompter that displayed text with randomized delays between characters, words, and lines.
We have agreed to modify the script so that each delay time will be unique and random for each character, rather than using the same delay time for all characters in a given word or line.
We added new functions to generate a unique delay for each character, word, and line, and modified the existing functions to use these new delays.
The modified script was tested and was confirmed to work as expected.
And here's a step by step plan of what we will now do to achieve our goal:

Define the variables and functions in a new file named "functions.sh".
Source the "functions.sh" file in the main script.
Refactor the code in the main script to make use of the functions defined in "functions.sh".
Test the refactored code to ensure that it works as expected.
Repeat the refactoring process for any additional functions and variables that are added in the future.
Continue to test the code regularly to ensure that it is working as expected and make any necessary modifications.
This plan is intended to provide a clear, organized approach to achieving our goal of creating a typing prompter script with unique and random delays for each character, word, and line.
