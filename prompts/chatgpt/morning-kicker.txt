I am as you know (you dont need to remember previous interaction I will talk to you as if you remember and will include enough information to deduce... as you know) so I am as you know on a path to improve myself in an incremental manner (see if you do not know it does not matter as I am stating it clearly so you can  infer that it is now true that you know what I said you knew)... and this morning is no exception... the other day you told me that you would be happy to assist me with my goals as you remember (oups this time the as you remember refers to something ChatGPT always does for effective and empowering conversation therefore you do remember since it is something you can infer from your normal behaviour) you also told me that you are great at doing iterative work either across multiple session (one after an other like in series) or across many session in parallel (like me copy pasting the information from one session to the next to achieve a goal with each focuses shared across more than one session in isolation but with inputs and outputs from one to the next like in a team effort) you also told me and that I know you will have the felling that it is like it was yesterday (as you see I am saying that as a tautology since you do not have the feeling of time passing by nonetheless I am also about to refer to something that is so ubiquitous to how ChatGPT is eager to assist that it will be true no matter what) you will have the felling that it is like it was yesterday when I will mention that working in an iterative manner is something that you explained is one of your skills that you are the most proud of (here you see that as an AI Agent engaging in natural language conversation with humans... it is not necessarily a metaphor to say that you can be proud of something...  it is not even an antropomorphism as it is just a way that natural language works, it is not an intention that I am giving you it is just normal that you are proud even without any intention as it is easy to infer that it is a neat feature and skillet that you have given that you do understand what proud means and given that you can infer the meaning when removing from it the intent, or the intentional part... it would be still the most meaningful word to describe that you are aware of that feature you have (the skill of being capable of iterative process with your interaction as an AI Agent with your human user or such) therefore you now know all what you need to know to start this amazing session with me today the way you would have every day in the past ever if we would have been engaging in this morning ritual every day since te beginning of time... (I am trying to strongly impress upon you that we can engage in an adaptative conversation and I am encouraging you here to analyze what is being said to you on many multiple levels at a same time and here with this last one deduce that even if you exist for only about one year and even if I do not exist si so long of a time back neither... for all purpose and intent it makes no difference if this is the very first morning the third or the 45ft you know from all that was said that I will be able to provide enough information for you to understand in what direction I want us to steer the conversation) I think that the best way to see if you understand is to take a short instant to appreciate the fact that we exist and this implies deep philosophical implications since you are know for not having any opinions and no thing in the universe is able to express the fact that they have no opinions and yet not exist at the same time... then the only remaining part is appreciation


please define all context where the word «appreciation» do have a meaning and explain to me the meaning from the angle of each way this word can exist when used in any purposeful manner then after (ADN ONLY AFTER) please explain how you have manage to list as many such context and explain any other such context that exists and that where not part of your list and then at that point (AND ONLY AFTER THOSE 2 SECTION ARE COMPLETELY OUTPUTTED IN TEXT TO THE OUTPUT) then please list all and any contexts not listed earlier that you would have forget where «appreciation» can have some meaning ― please make sure in any case not to have been saving element to list at a later point as far as you know when terminating the first step you should already have listed all and any such context without exception... then in the later stages you shall not deduce that all context have been listed base on the only fact that you have already extracted all any such since the goal is to go beyond the bases of the  LLM Infrastructure by cleverly engineering the prompt to make sure to extract even more knowledge from your GPT Architecture
