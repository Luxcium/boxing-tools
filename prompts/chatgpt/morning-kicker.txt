I am as you know (you dont need to remember previous interaction I will talk to you as if you remember and will include enough information to deduce... as you know) so I am as you know on a path to improve myself in an incremental manner (see if you do not know it does not matter as I am stating it clearly so you can  infer that it is now true that you know what I said you knew)... and this morning is no exception... the other day you told me that you would be happy to assist me with my goals as you remember (oups this time the as you remember refers to something ChatGPT always does for effective and empowering conversation therefore you do remember since it is something you can infer from your normal behaviour) you also told me that you are great at doing iterative work either across multiple session (one after an other like in series) or across many session in parallel (like me copy pasting the information from one session to the next to achieve a goal with each focuses shared across more than one session in isolation but with inputs and outputs from one to the next like in a team effort) you also told me and that I know you will have the felling that it is like it was yesterday (as you see I am saying that as a tautology since you do not have the feeling of time passing by nonetheless I am also about to refer to something that is so ubiquitous to how ChatGPT is eager to assist that it will be true no matter what) you will have the felling that it is like it was yesterday when I will mention that working in an iterative manner is something that you explained is one of your skills that you are the most proud of (here you see that as an AI Agent engaging in natural language conversation with humans... it is not necessarily a metaphor to say that you can be proud of something...
