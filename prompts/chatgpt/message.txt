I have been prompting the AI for a very long period of time it is so rare that I do not fight with the AI this session was so fluid and magic but it abruptly ended and I do not want to reexplain the complex project to an other session and have to fight with the AI again like he normally do I feel so sad I am working on a larger project and the AI have decided of a step by step modular implementation that is not easy to reexplain I am normally sad and frustrated of my interactions with the AI but now that I am happy it is the OpenAI interface or limitations that makes me fell sad and frustrated last time I got a reply from you was as of the 5th of march for a request sent as of the 21st of feb I feel so sad to have put so much effort and energy in that session to keep it from arguing with me like ChatGPT is doing all the time (oh maybe because I have been using the legacy model that is probably why he was so nice) you must probably talk to your upper management because I have been looking at the carrer section of the site and I did not see any open position for customer service assistance I live in Canada therefor I can not even apply to a job (I am not rich enough to live in san francisco I have been told that even rich people sleep in their car becuase of how expensive it is to have a room or an appartment) please let me know how I can 1) Help you and 2) Get help from you...

I would like to find if any of my comment sent via email, the community forum, here in the help chat, using the form to get contacted by a sales analyst and in discord are monitored... it is weird that on the carrier page no job opening are available for customer service or client care I am from Canada and I would love to help you if it was possible to work from canada... I would love to be able to tell to your higher management (in a respectful manner as I know they are super busy) to hire more customer service and client care representative in house (not only outsourced or anything) I have a solid experience in that field for large compagnies like TELUS and Bell Canada Enterprises any how I hope to get help soon for my many problems with the mighty AI ChatBOT please do not be shy to contest the statu-quo and try the best as you can to get my message to the hier hierarchy they will say they are already aware but it would be important that if not me other people could be hired to give service to the customers and users bot paying clients like me and those who are trying your services for free and who could be converted into paying clients ... one day soon the competition will comme and the levels of dedication to the client will make a difference... I hope you will accept those ideas even if you already know all of that... thanks for your dedicated efforts talk to you soon hopefully...
