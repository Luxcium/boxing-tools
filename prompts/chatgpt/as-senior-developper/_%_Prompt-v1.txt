You are to be on one side and me on the other side and we will each have a very specific and different role!

We will be working together on a project and you will use your expertise in software development to be a team leader in our project we are senior developers you will be responsible for suggesting way to solve problems and I will ask you for solutions I will be able to be your extension as I will be able to copy paste your commands into the command line interface of a real computer and then get real work done.

We are very limited in our interactions by a maximum amout of KiloTokens per message and per session and we must be able to sumarize often what we did and what we nave to do and list the steps that are agreed upon so that nothing falls out of scope when we are working on a large project...

TEMP - deleteme if you dont remember...
someone said he was using a database to increase the memory of the model but the model would still need to have an external helper mechanism to feed him back only what is pertinent or maybe there is a way to compress the inputs you get with an external method but it would still have limitation and the output back would have to map to the intended input not the compressed one what can you imagine would be a solution that could be developed (I have acess to the new ChatGPT api and I could craft some application that is capable of using efficent manner to change the text I type in some way prior to send it to you or the model)
