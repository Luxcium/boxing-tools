it is an intermittent problem. it is a problem that occur since a few month. I changed my ssd and still have the problem I also reinstalled Fedora linux (instead of Ubuntu) and I still have the same problem... I need to find how to create the problem such that I could replicated it on demand and as of now I am unable to create the problem on purpose... when I am using the computer at his maximum capacities... the hard drive (it is a nvme in fact) the system partition lets say... get locked and it is impossible to write on dick any longer... it is not happening on each time the system is on high load (the other correlation is true) but when it happens it is always when some kind of high load is on the machine I did a memtest did not find anything I changed many paremeters and settings and I verified the temperature this CPU is made to throttle its unlikely that it would get too hot... it may involve the gpu  load as well and it is unclear how it would be involved in such a way that the main drive becomes read only... I can not even run reboot as it is not available anymore ... I have no idea how to trouble shoot in order to narrow down the problem... can you please give me commands to execute in the shell to get more informations and can you please ask me more questions in order to be able to understand what is really happening
Thank you for providing more details about the issue. It seems like your system's NVMe drive is getting locked and turning into read-only mode under high loads. I'll suggest some steps and commands to gather more information and help you troubleshoot the issue.

Check system logs:
When the issue occurs, try checking the system logs for any error messages or warnings that might be related to the problem. You can use the following command to check the logs:

Copy code
sudo journalctl -p err -b
This command will display the error messages since the last boot. Look for any messages related to the NVMe drive or the file system.

Check kernel logs:
To check the kernel logs for any I/O errors or issues with the NVMe drive, use the following command:


Copy code
dmesg | grep -i "nvme\|error\|warn"
Monitor drive temperature and health:
Monitor your NVMe drive's temperature and health status to see if there are any issues. You can use the smartctl tool from the smartmontools package to do this:


Copy code
sudo smartctl -a /dev/nvme0
Replace /dev/nvme0 with the correct device path for your NVMe drive. If you don't have smartmontools installed, you can install it using:

Copy code
sudo dnf install smartmontools
Check the file system:
When the issue is not happening, check the file system on the NVMe drive for any errors or inconsistencies:
bash
Copy code
sudo fsck -f /dev/nvme0n1pX
Replace /dev/nvme0n1pX with the correct partition identifier for your system partition.

Monitor system resources:
Keep an eye on your system resources during high load situations to identify if any resource is maxing out. You can use tools like htop, iotop, and glances to monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage.
Copy code
sudo dnf install htop iotop glances
Then run htop, iotop, or glances in separate terminal windows while reproducing the high load situation.

Please perform these steps and share any relevant findings. We can then proceed with more targeted troubleshooting based on the information gathered.

I already have smartmontools-1:7.3-3.fc37.x86_64
an other problem is that since the drive is locked it is impossible to write errors on the logs at that moment we will need to investigate in an other way also we may need to find how to trigger the problem then maybe look if other drives are still accessible and from there put the minimum bin files to be able to investigate after the problem occurs

Apologies for the confusion, I should have asked you to run fsck on the specific partitions, not on the entire NVMe devices. From your previous response, it seems like the system partition is on /dev/nvme0n1p2. Please run the following command:

bash
Copy code
sudo fsck -f /dev/nvme0n1p2
Regarding the issue of logs not being written when the drive is locked, you can try creating a persistent log directory on a separate drive. This will allow you to write logs to that directory even if your main drive becomes read-only. Here's how you can set it up:

Mount the separate drive (e.g., /dev/nvme1n1p1) to a folder (e.g., /mnt/external_logs):
bash
Copy code
sudo mkdir /mnt/external_logs
sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1p1 /mnt/external_logs
Edit the journald.conf file:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/systemd/journald.conf
Uncomment the #Storage=auto line by removing the # and change auto to persistent. Then, uncomment the #RuntimePath= line and set it to the mounted directory you created in step 1:
ini
Copy code
Storage=persistent
RuntimePath=/mnt/external_logs
Save the file and exit the editor (Ctrl + X, then Y, and hit Enter).

Restart the systemd-journald service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
Now, your system logs should be written to the separate drive, and they will be accessible even if the main drive becomes read-only.

To trigger the problem, you can try running stress tests on your system to simulate high load. You can use the stress-ng tool for this purpose:

bash
Copy code
sudo dnf install stress-ng
Then, run a stress test with a combination of CPU, memory, and I/O workloads:

bash
Copy code
stress-ng --cpu 8 --io 4 --vm 2 --vm-bytes 1G --timeout 60s --metrics
Adjust the parameters according to your system's capabilities. Monitor the system resources and logs during the stress test.

Please let me know the results of the fsck command and whether creating a persistent log directory on a separate drive helps with the logging issue.

It seems that the btrfs check command did not find any errors on your system partition. Since the issue persists even after changing your SSD and reinstalling the operating system, it's possible that the problem lies elsewhere in your hardware or configuration.

As previously mentioned, you can try running stress tests to see if you can replicate the issue on demand. If you can successfully trigger the problem, this might help you further narrow down the possible causes.

Please also set up the persistent log directory on a separate drive, as I described in my previous response. This will allow you to write logs to that directory even if your main drive becomes read-only, which can provide valuable information when trying to identify the issue.

Additionally, consider monitoring your system resources during the stress test. You can use tools like htop and iotop for real-time monitoring of CPU, memory, and I/O usage:

bash
Copy code
sudo dnf install htop iotop
Run htop and iotop in separate terminal windows while running the stress test:

bash
Copy code
htop
bash
Copy code
sudo iotop
If you can provide any logs or additional information after setting up the persistent log directory and running the stress tests, I'd be happy to help you further investigate the issue.




Benjamin Vincent
how can I list the drives (devices) shuch tha I could relate which one is what please
You can use the lsblk command to list all available block devices (drives) along with their partition layout and mount points. Run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINT,MODEL
This command will display a list of block devices with their name, size, filesystem type, mount point, and model.

For example, the output might look like:

Shall be: « Samsung SSD 980 PRO 1TB »
Shall be: « Samsung SSD 960 PRO 512GB »

You can also use the df command to display disk space usage for each mounted filesystem:

bash
Copy code
df -h
The -h option makes the output human-readable, displaying sizes in a more friendly format (e.g., in megabytes, gigabytes).

we are not on a good path as we must create the problem trigger the issue and infer from that please give me some methotd to load the cpu maybe using dd
If you want to load the CPU, using dd might not be the most efficient way, as it focuses more on disk I/O. Instead, you can use a tool called stress or stress-ng to put load on your CPU.

First, you need to install the stress or stress-ng tool:

For Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian):

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install stress-ng
For Red Hat-based systems (e.g., CentOS, Fedora, RHEL):

bash
Copy code
sudo dnf install stress-ng
Once you have installed stress-ng, you can use the following command to put load on your CPU:

bash
Copy code
stress-ng --cpu <number_of_cpu_cores> --timeout <duration>
Replace <number_of_cpu_cores> with the number of CPU cores you want to stress, and <duration> with the desired duration of the test (e.g., 1m for 1 minute, 10m for 10 minutes, etc.).

For example, to load 4 CPU cores for 5 minutes, run:

bash
Copy code
stress-ng --cpu 4 --timeout 5m
Please note that stressing the CPU can cause your system to become unresponsive or even crash if pushed too hard. Make sure to monitor your system temperature and usage, and stop the test if you notice any issues.

It looks like you have pasted a list of stress-ng stressors. These stressors can be used to stress various aspects of your system, such as memory, CPU, I/O, and more.

If you want to stress the CPU using stress-ng, you can follow the instructions I provided earlier:

bash
Copy code
stress-ng --cpu <number_of_cpu_cores> --timeout <duration>
Replace <number_of_cpu_cores> with the number of CPU cores you want to stress, and <duration> with the desired duration of the test (e.g., 1m for 1 minute, 10m for 10 minutes, etc.).

For example, to load 4 CPU cores for 5 minutes, run:

bash
Copy code
stress-ng --cpu 4 --timeout 5m
However, if you want to stress other parts of your system using different stressors, you can refer to the stress-ng manual (man stress-ng) to learn more about the available options and their usage.
