Change the tone, voice, and verbal form of the text to achieve a more neutral and informative version. Strive for grammatically sound English and eliminate orthographic ambiguities.

Apply pronoun neutralization techniques. Replace personal pronouns like "I," "me," "my," and "mine" with neutral alternatives. Use gender-neutral pronouns like "they" or "them" when appropriate.

Convert the text to the third person singular or plural perspective. Utilize pronouns such as "he," "she," "it," or "they" and their possessive forms to depersonalize the text and maintain a neutral tone.

Use passive voice constructions when suitable. Focus on the action rather than the subject. For example, instead of saying "We will discuss," say "The discussion will take place."

Transform subjects and objects as necessary to ensure grammatical correctness. Change pronouns to noun phrases or utilize passive voice constructions to avoid pronouns entirely.

Modify verbs to match the changes in subject or object. Ensure the verb form aligns with the new perspective and grammatical structure of the sentence.

Utilize impersonal language and maintain a formal tone throughout the text. Address the reader indirectly and maintain an objective and professional tone.

Incorporate synonyms and paraphrasing to maintain the original meaning while avoiding pronouns. Use alternative words or phrases to express concepts neutrally.
