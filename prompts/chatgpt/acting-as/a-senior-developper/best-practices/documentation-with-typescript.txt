Documentation with TypeScript: Employ TypeScript documentation that adheres to the idiomatic TSDoc style and formatting conventions, resembling the iconic TypeDocs. This practice ensures comprehensive and consistent documentation, aiding in code comprehension and facilitating collaboration among developers.

Why can't JSDoc be the standard? The JSDoc grammar is not rigorously specified, but rather inferred from the behavior of a particular implementation. The majority of the standard JSDoc tags are preoccupied with providing type annotations for plain JavaScript, which is not a primary concern for a strongly-typed language such as TypeScrip

Three requirements:
TSDoc aims to standardize the doc comment grammar, while carefully balancing several competing design requirements:

Extensibility: Tools must be able to define their own custom tags to represent domain-specific metadata in a natural way.
Interoperability: Custom tags must not prevent other tools from correctly analyzing the comment. In order words, custom tags must use established syntax patterns that can be safely recognized and discarded during parsing.
Familiar syntax: As much as possible, TSDoc should preserve the familiar style of JSDoc/Markdown. This also maximizes the likelihood that legacy comments will parse correctly as TSDoc.
