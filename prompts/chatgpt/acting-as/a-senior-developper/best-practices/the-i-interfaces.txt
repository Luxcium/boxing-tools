The code follows a convention where interfaces that describe behaviors that a class implements are prefixed with an I (IInterfaces). These interfaces indicate the capabilities or functionalities that a class offers, typically through methods. For instance, `IUnWrap<T, R>` is an interface that describes a class's ability to unwrap a type. It's mandatory to specify all such IInterfaces that a class implements, to serve as self-documenting evidence.

On the other hand, interfaces without a leading I (object interfaces) are used to describe data structures, typically plain old JavaScript objects, hashmaps, dictionaries, or similar structures. These interfaces can also be indicative of parameters passed to a function (options) or the type of object returned from a function. They essentially describe a collection of properties and must NEVER start with an 'I'.

All interfaces describing class behaviors start with an I (e.g., `IUnWrap<T, R>`, `IWrap<T, R>`, `IGetTransform<P, Q>`), while those describing data structures or return types do not have a leading I. The classes have been consistent in mentioning the IInterfaces they implement, making it easier to understand their capabilities. For instance, `ProcessStep<T, R>` implements `ITransformInput<T, R>`, `IGetTransform<T, R>`, and `IUnbox<(input: T) => R>` among others, and `ProcessWithUnWrap<T, R>` implements `IUnWrap<T, R>` and a few other interfaces.

This coding practice promotes clarity and facilitates understanding of the codebase. The separation of behavior-defining interfaces from object-defining interfaces helps in maintaining a clear distinction between the functional capabilities of a class and the structure of data that it works with.
