Topic: Functional Programming Constructs: Inboxing, Mapping, and Unboxing

Context: We have been discussing the concepts of inboxing (or lifting), mapping, and unboxing in the context of functional programming. These concepts involve encapsulating a value, transforming the encapsulated value, and extracting the transformed value, respectively.

Action items:
1. Summarize the concepts of inboxing, mapping, and unboxing.
2. Provide synonyms and alternatives for each concept.
3. Explore existing patterns or paradigms related to inboxing, mapping, and unboxing.
4. Discuss the academic and theoretical aspects of these concepts.
5. Explain the relevance of these concepts in functional programming and their potential use in the user's work.

Key points:
- Inboxing (or lifting) involves encapsulating a value within a construct, providing a context for further operations.
- Mapping refers to transforming the internal value of a construct by applying a function or operation.
- Unboxing involves extracting the encapsulated value from the construct for further use or accessing the transformed value.
- The concepts of inboxing, mapping, and unboxing are relevant in functional programming for managing state, controlling side effects, and promoting modularity.
- Synonyms and alternatives for inboxing, mapping, and unboxing include encapsulation, wrapping, packaging, transforming, processing, and retrieving, among others.

Contextual information: The user has created their own personal paradigms based on their needs in functional programming and is seeking to understand if these concepts already exist or if new conventions need to be created.
