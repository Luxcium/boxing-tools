can you tell me where to connect my internet cable to benefit of the best connetion betwen Intel® LAN port (LAN2)* (5. left on the scematics top on my computer) and Intel® LAN port (LAN1)* (6. right on the scematics bottom on my computer)
only on the asus website description page I can find this information about the LAN:

Intel® I219V, 1 x Gigabit LAN Controller(s), featuring Turbo LAN
Intel® I211, 1 x Gigabit LAN, featuring Turbo LAN
ASUS Turbo LAN Utility

after a review of the TUF X299 MARK 1 (Asus) manual I can find this information about the LAN:

Gigabit Intel LAN connection- 802.3az Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE)
appliance
Intel® I219-V Gigabit LAN- Dual interconnect between the integrated Media
Access Controller (MAC) and physical layer (PHY)
Intel® I211 Gigabit LAN controller
TUF LANGuard
ASUS Turbo LAN Utility

They mention that the back panel has  «2 x LAN (RJ45) ports»

in the mention of an ASUS feature that sounds more like marketing rather than meaning anything (at least to me you can explain the value if you understand anything): «- Turbo LAN to experience smooth online gaming with lower pings and less
lags»

the position of the «Intel® LAN port (LAN2)* » and the «Intel® LAN port (LAN1)* » on the schematics

and the mention to «*: Refer to the tables on the next page for LAN port LEDs port definitions»

and sure enough on the next page is explained what are the 2 leds indicates on any of the LAN  port «* LAN ports LED indications»  and the schematics and explanation is there I will not include it as it do not help to find which one is what then the same information is in 2 different section of the docs «You can disable the LAN controllers in BIOS. Due to hardware design, the LAN1 port’s
LEDs may continue to blink even when disabled.» and «Intel LAN Controller
This item allows you to enable or disable the Intel LAN controller.
Configuration options: [Disabled] [Enabled]»
/////////////////////////

so unless you have any awareness of what is the specific port and connector and its location then we can not decide anything about which one is

Intel® I219V, 1 x Gigabit LAN Controller(s), featuring Turbo LAN
Intel® I211, 1 x Gigabit LAN, featuring Turbo LAN

on my ASUSTeK TUF X299 MARK 1 with Chipset Intel® X299

Based on the information you provided, it appears that your motherboard has the following LAN-related features:

Gigabit Intel LAN connection: This refers to the integrated Ethernet interface on the motherboard, which supports Gigabit Ethernet (10/100/1000 Mbps) speeds. The motherboard documentation mentions that this interface supports 802.3az Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE), which is a standard that reduces power consumption during periods of low network activity.

Intel® I219-V Gigabit LAN: This is a specific Gigabit Ethernet controller from Intel that is used on the motherboard. It supports dual interconnect between the integrated Media Access Controller (MAC) and physical layer (PHY), which can improve network performance.

Intel® I211 Gigabit LAN controller: This is another Gigabit Ethernet controller from Intel that is used on the motherboard. It is designed for dual-Gigabit Ethernet connections and supports a maximum data rate of 2 Gbps.

TUF LANGuard: This is a feature that is designed to protect the Ethernet interface from voltage spikes and electrostatic discharge (ESD). It uses specialized capacitors and surge protection circuits to provide additional protection for the LAN port.

ASUS Turbo LAN Utility: This is a software utility that is designed to optimize network traffic and reduce latency for smoother online gaming and streaming. It works by prioritizing network packets and reducing network congestion.

Overall, these LAN-related features are designed to provide reliable and high-speed network connectivity for the system, as well as advanced features such as EEE support, dual interconnects, and protection against voltage spikes and ESD.
