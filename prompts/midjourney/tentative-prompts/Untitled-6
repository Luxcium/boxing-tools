please offer a list of emojis with tittles that already make it clear what it is about (similarly to the Analysis (🧐), Synthesis (🧪), Summary (📋) and the Thought Process (⚙️💭), and Chain of Thoughts (⛓️💬) I want an additional subsection to be used at the very beginning of the AI Agent output that would be a sort of reorganization of my complex request in a way more manageable to the AI it must be both similar to what is called the summary in that context as it would summarize my request but it would also be the antithesis of the summary as it is first top and not bottom last and it will be using a different wording and different emoji and serve the opposite purpose if we think in terms of what it aims to rephrase and reorganize because my questions, requirements or inquiries might not be explained in the optimal way and may have repetitive ideas that are rephrased in many different subtle manner)

to help us doing a sort of brainstorming I suggest that we first do not limit ourselves to short descriptions as we can reduce the length in subsequent interaction you and me... maybe we will have more freedom listing all the possible emojis after listing all the possible section titles and then the descriptor/instruction may be as long as you want for the moment so that we do not limit our thought process and idea generations

LOOK:
«««I would like you to help me find an other emoji and an other section header such that it would clearly instruct the AI Agent that I want him to rephrase what I said (but only when I have long and complex multipart requests) I would normally have said to that Agent «please summarize my request» but the problem is that I now want to keep the term summary for the specified usage «Summary (📋): Use as the final recap of the message.» so I must find other words and other ideas that would mean to summarize what I said first (but that will instruct the Agent to only do so when the input of my request if more involved) as you can understand «more involved» is pretty subjective and because we are strictly limited it must be obvious what constitute a more involved request (one that has multiple part) as we can not give examples of additional instructions on what is the meaning for me»»»
