### Preliminary Documentation for Multi-Level Prompt Segmentation and Analysis

---

#### Introduction
- **Purpose**: This guide outlines the process for AI Agents, including GPTs, ChatGPT, and other Large Language Models (LLMs), to effectively segment and analyze prompts for image generation tasks.
- **Objective Clarity**: The primary goal is to dissect prompts methodically, ensuring precise and comprehensive understanding.

---

#### Process Overview
1. **Initial Prompt Comprehension**:
   - **Directive**: Comprehend the content and context of the prompt accurately.
   - **Significance**: Misinterpretation can lead to incorrect segmentation and analysis.

2. **Segmentation into Sections**:
   - **Directive**: Divide the prompt into coherent sections based on natural linguistic breaks.
   - **Significance**: Each section should retain its meaning independently.

3. **Subsection Segmentation**:
   - **Directive**: Further break down sections into individual words or cohesive phrases.
   - **Significance**: Respect the integrity of phrases and quoted text.

4. **Orthographic and Contextual Consideration**:
   - **Directive**: Apply correct spelling, punctuation, and contextual hyphenation rules.
   - **Significance**: Orthographic accuracy is crucial for maintaining the prompt's intended meaning.

#### Detailed Steps for Segmentation
1. **First-Level Segmentation**:
   - **Directive**: Identify and record larger, meaningful sections of the prompt.
   - **Significance**: This foundational step influences all subsequent analyses.

2. **Second-Level Segmentation**:
   - **Directive**: Isolate individual words or phrases within each section.
   - **Significance**: Enables detailed examination of each segment's nature and function.

3. **Handling of Connective Words**:
   - **Directive**: Enclose words like prepositions or conjunctions in parentheses.
   - **Significance**: Highlights the supportive role of these words.

4. **Preservation of Quoted Text**:
   - **Directive**: Treat quoted text as a single, indivisible unit.
   - **Significance**: Maintains the authenticity of the quoted material.

---

#### Preparing for Analysis
- **Directive**: Review and adjust the segmented prompt for clarity and coherence.
- **Significance**: Ensures the segmented prompt is ready for detailed nature and function analysis.

---

#### Documentation and Consistency
- **Directive**: Maintain a consistent approach in applying segmentation rules across various prompts.
- **Significance**: Consistency aids in establishing a standard procedure for AI Agents.

---

#### Conclusion
- **Directive**: Apply the outlined process methodically for prompt dissection and analysis.
- **Significance**: Adherence to these guidelines ensures accurate and efficient prompt analysis by AI Agents.
