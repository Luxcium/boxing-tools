Commercial is good for well lit shots, like models and advertising
Product is good for an isolated shot, for a single product, a pair of shoes for example
Food is top down like a restaurant menu or recipe book
Selfie is a close up as if from a mobile phone front camera, sometimes will contain a phone
Amateur and Candid can be used for less professional shots, like holiday snaps or people looking away from the camera (sometimes but not always)

This is very generally, and totally depends on your prompt and parameters
