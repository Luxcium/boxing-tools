# Guide to V6 Prompting System

V6 introduces a transformative approach to image prompting, leveraging enhanced semantics and natural language processing. The `/imagine` command benefits from significantly increased memory, allowing for elaborate and lengthy prompts that can intricately control the composition, include multiple subjects, and integrate text.

## Features at a Glance

- Extensive prompt length, supporting 350+ words.
- Detailed control over colors and other specifics.
- Spatial arrangement of elements via descriptive language.
- Ability to add textual elements to images.
- Multiple subjects can be included in a single prompt.
- Conversational prompting, akin to interacting with AI like ChatGPT.
- Sensitivity to punctuation and grammatical nuances.
- Comic creation capabilities.
- Improved handling of natural language negatives.
- Option to describe and include frames or borders in images.
- Avoidance of multiprompts is recommended.

## Deep Dive into Major Changes

1. **Prompt Length**: The memory increase translates to a "semantic cap," allowing for a broader range of descriptive detail.
2. **Detail Specification**: Control over the rendering of details is now more nuanced and responsive to natural language.
3. **Composition Control**: Prepositional phrases are now better understood, enabling precise placement of subjects.
4. **Text Integration**: Text can be incorporated within images by using quotation marks and contextually appropriate descriptors.
5. **Multiple Subjects**: V6 can beautifully render multiple subjects without blending, a significant improvement over V5.
6. **Troubleshooting Blurry Details**: Strategies include reducing details, adding specificity, and coherency chasing.
7. **Missing Details**: Address missing elements by restructuring the prompt or experimenting with alternate phrasing.
8. **New Discoveries**: Encouragement to share novel uses and strategies within the community.

## Additional Highlights

- Direct prompting is now more intuitive, with instructions being interpreted more accurately.
- Punctuation and grammar nuances are crucial for achieving the desired outcomes.
- Creation of comics is facilitated by the system's understanding of scenes and panel arrangement.
- Negative language processing allows for the exclusion of certain elements in generated images.
- Frames and borders can be added by simply describing them in the prompt.

This guide is meant to help both AI and humans understand the V6 system's capabilities and how to utilize them effectively for creating images.

## Speaking Midjourney (V6) Overview

### Language Proficiency in Midjourney V6

游릭 Midjourney V6 excels at interpreting natural language, so precise spelling and punctuation are essential.
游릭 For optimal results, natural language should be used to describe scenes with several subjects and detailed specifics.

### Effective Prompt Examples

游릭 **DO**: Describe a scene with "Three best friends sitting closely on a park bench," including detailed descriptions of appearance and background, which is important for multiple subjects.
游릭 **DO**: Portray "An adult Caucasian hipster man with specific facial features and attire, using a computer in a twilight home library," capturing the scene in a distinctive artistic style.
游릭 **DO**: Capture "A queen on a cliff," with elaborate descriptions of her surroundings and reactions, styled like a photograph.
游릭 **DO**: Illustrate "Herman in distress over lost keys," focusing on the emotional detail of the moment.

### Guidance on Sequential Actions and Descriptive Negatives

游댮 **DON'T**: Describe a sequence of actions; they will be merged into a single scene.
游댮 **DON'T**: Use negative descriptors to indicate absence; the system tends to include rather than exclude.

### Successful Integration of Absence

游릭 **DO**: "A boy in a parking lot with keys, with no cars nearby."
游릭 **DO**: "A beach scene described as being devoid of people."

### Conversing with Midjourney

游릭 Midjourney can understand direct, ChatGPT-like instructions but has limitations when it comes to specific commands or remixes.

## Prompt Length in Midjourney V6

### Concept of Prompt Length

In V6, the concept of prompt length is governed by semantics rather than a strict word count. The system evaluates the complexity of the rendering task rather than the number of words used.

### Understanding the Semantic Cap

Images may begin to lose clarity when the prompt's "semantic cap" is reached. This cap is influenced by the complexity of the scene, the number of subjects, and the level of detail, rather than the word count alone. The cap could be reached with as few as 50 words or as many as 350, depending on the prompt's content.

### Words That Contribute to the Canvas

游릭 **DO** use words that actively contribute to image creation, such as:

- Visually Relevant Prepositions: "above," "below," "beside," and similar terms that define spatial relationships.
- Visually Descriptive Adjectives: Words like "crowded," "serene," or "glossy" that convey appearance.
- Visually Descriptive Adverbs: Adverbs including "vividly," "subtly," or "dramatically" that enhance the visual description.
- Nouns: Clear subjects like "mountain," "river," "cat," etc.
- Direct Art and Cultural References: Specific mentions of art styles, cultural elements, and architectural details.

### Words That Have Less Impact

游댮 **DON'T** rely on words that have minimal impact on the visual output, such as:

- Intensifiers: "extremely," "insanely," "remarkably," and other similar modifiers that don't translate visually.
- Formal Language: Words like "henceforth," "nevertheless," and "thusly" that add complexity without visual relevance.
- Time Words: "until," "after," "since," which don't generally affect the visual aspects.
- Technical Jargon: Terms like "4k," "hdr," "dpi," which are not visually interpretative in the context of the image.

### Example of an Effective Prompt

An example prompt is given that illustrates how these principles apply in practice, using the V6 system with specific settings to focus on meaningful words and enhance the visual output.
