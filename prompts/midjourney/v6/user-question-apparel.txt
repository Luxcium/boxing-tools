OK, so if you are able to skip the introduction of your answer and the conclusion of your answer, which are very long at times, and if you only give me answer, and then we can do back and forth, which I call a ping-pong round session to illustrate how quick I want the interaction to be, it may be interesting. I will try that with you. I will be happy to hear you list all the ways you can achieve this with me today.
User
Oh, I got caught off guard. I'm sorry, I was eating. And yes, you're faster. I'm happy that you will repeat it in your first few questions, the ways that... Oh, sorry, answers. In your first few answers, you will repeat how you will be quick. I have a question about the man wears, the hat they wear, the new way that young people always have baseball cap and stuff. I would like to ask question about these topics with you today.
User
So from my point of view, the youth mode, or fashion industry and stuff, or just the trends, is that somehow baseball caps are ubiquitous. And I would like to know how we can name those things in English, and if there is other ways of talking about these things.
User
I would like to talk about those baseball caps and the nomenclature or the name, the way of naming these specific baseball caps and then snapback also are a type of these things I'm talking about.
User
No, no, I don't want details on history. Please skip that part because I want to go fast and do a ping-pong round. I would prefer to have instead the details on their shape overall, which I mean is that for me, from my point of view, there is two shapes. There are one that is more squared in shape or more, you know, bulky or stuff. And there's the other one for me, which is the one that is more round and that will follow the shape of the head and that will have a brim in the front that is more round also. And I would like to differentiate those two types and have the vocabulary to be able to differentiate all those things together from one another. I would like you to help me to gain more understanding on how these things can be named with words and differentiated with words.
User
It's a good start to help me differentiate those things, but I would like to dive deeper in these things, these differentiations, and to learn more about all that, because I'm using MidJourney to create images, and more often than not, I don't get the style I'm looking for, and so I need to be taught more in-depth vocabulary and learn more words to be able to describe what I want more accurately.
User
I would like to be able to produce images of boys that are older, like young men that are either young adult or older teenager, and I would like to be able to describe with words to mid-journey what exactly I am talking about, and I would like to be able to describe those as teenagers so that it's easier to get someone that looks younger, and because I would like them to be adults, I think that you have 18 and 19 that are words ending in T, so the oldest way to get a teenager, I think it's to have a 19 years old person. I use that number a lot to demonstrate that I want someone young but an adult also at the same time. I would like to be able to think about those things I was asking about baseball caps and apply them to this context. Can you give me some insight on these boys or men wearing that kind of hat?
User
It goes in the right direction. This approach is very interesting. I would like to have more words like streetwear, urban, and stuff like that, that will be able to help me steer the style of the image and the gender of people that, well, not gender in the sense of their gender identity, but in the sense of kinds of people that, well, they are all boys, so there's no problem with knowing if they are men or girls or women, but, I mean, I'm sorry, I would like to think about the fact that streetwear and stuff like that can be a good hint on the overall ambience and style of clothing, and I would like you to have me gain more vocabulary in these contexts, please.
User
Oh my god, this is very interesting. I'm happy that you mentioned each of these things. Can you take each of the words that you already mentioned and then give a small expansion on each, like for backpack or for cotton or for, well, each of those things you said, can you maybe expand on each of them so that I have, like, words that would make the image more steered at a younger look of teenagers that are, you know, in that style that is so iconic to the modern version of what a teenager looks like? Like,
User
Thank you very much, ChatGPT. Those descriptions helped me visualize and articulate the styles I am aiming for. But now, I would like to dig even deeper. From each of those main words you listed, a few of them are objects, like hoodie, cargo pants, sneaker, and stuff like that. And maybe also cotton, or backpack is one other object. For those things that are object, maybe not minimalist, but all the other, can you list a synonym, make a list of as many synonyms of each word, and then give a small, short description for each new word you're introducing?
User
These are helpful, but they are not what I was aiming for. I would like to have an expensive set or a set of synonyms that extend beyond what the words are that will add more type of things. So for a hoodie, it could be a jacket, a t-shirt, and stuff like that. For a cargo pant, it could be like jogger pants, or shorts, or other kind of pants. For cotton, it could have been, you know, synthetics fiber, and then naming a few of them. For backpack, it could have been other ways of carrying things. And also for a few other words in your previous list, where you have sunglasses, I would like to have maybe glasses and other type of accessory. And for things like camouflage, and graphic prints, those two could be extended with more type of things. For things like graphic tees, it could be also expanded. And then you could be able to go deeper in what athleisure could be including. And hip-hop inspired and skater style could be of a subset of more items that describe young people or young boys that are in the teenage, late teenage or young adult. And that ubiquitous style I'm trying to define, which is not clear in one word. There is a lot of words, as you mentioned, but it's the reason why I would like to expand on each of these things. Can you help me please by listing synonyms that are expansive, that extend the topic instead of synonyms that are just limited to exactly the same thing that it was?
User
Thank you very much to give me expanded description that do align with what I'm looking to express in my image prompt. Now I would like to go further. Now that we did that, I would like to take the UDI part of it and each of those you mentioned, then can you give me a description of each words and also add a few more? Then if you can do the same for the sneakers, the shoes and stuff, if you can also expand definition on each of the synonyms and expand more the list of synonyms, giving you a description for each. And that you could be adding the t-shirt and the pants to have more expanded list of upper wear and down wear. I'm sorry, it's not word, but the up and down. And then I would like to know if you can expand on the cotton sweater pants that are so ubiquitous. They are often gray in color and I would like to have other words specific to describe cotton pants. Those that are gray and also please list other name of color that are gray, like graphite and stuff, and expand a list of words of color that will describe gray cotton pants with more similar color that are gray, but or from white to black or other type of these colors.
User
Thank you. Discovered a range of clothing items and color I was looking for. Now I would like to do another kind of expansion or an extension. Either way, I would like to think about the brands. There are a lot of brands in this area and you know those brands are iconic and they are like all over the place and I would like to think about the most ubiquitous or the one that is everywhere first and then go down the list in terms of that style I'm trying to describe. So please first explain the style that you think I am trying to describe about those people that are male of a certain age and how they are looking. Explain to me what you understand about what I'm trying to figure out and then from based on your description, list the brands starting by the most common and the most ubiquitous brand and down list all brands that young people in that category may expose on their clothes and that are maybe visible or that may be iconic or what else. Please be expensive and expand your list and be able to give the most detail and a short description. You may avoid historical reference. I don't need to know where the company started and stuff. I want to have a description of the meaning of the brand for people that are seeing them and what people think of brand when they see it or what is the first idea in mind that people may have for each of these brands.
User
Yes, thank you. This does align with the brand-related insight I was seeking, but as you will understand, I am always asking to expand everything because I want to have the wider range of knowledge about each of these things. I would like to know if you are aware of the K line that was formerly called Kappa, the Greek letter for K, or the Kappa brand, and I would like to have those brands stated by European tendents and American tendents, and I would like to be able to expand the list of brand names, and if you can do this by stating other brands that have not been mentioned yet, and that will be taught from the perspective of an European and from the perspective of an American person, naming the most iconic top of the list brand similar to those you already named. Not specifically iFashion, but more in line with those you said. Not only sport, it could be something else, but I think sport aligns more with what it is. I know that Nike Skateboard is one, and maybe one of the other you already named have other sub-brands like Nike Skateboard is an example of, and then I would like you to explain me the difference for people that will be 15 years old compared to people that are 19 years old. In the context of what I am describing, you said demographic earlier, and in the context of demographic, I would like to know what is the difference between a 15 year old and a 19 year old in this context of clothing and streetwear and stuff that is related to all of these, but that should be a last part of your question because I want to focus on the earlier part, which is the European and American aspect of listing more of those brands.
User
Yes, thank you. It gives me a good, you know, a good idea of what I wanted. So, thank you. I would like to know because I want to give an impression more obvious of this type of thing. So, I think that having 19 years old in the prompt gives more latitude or more possibility like to have tattoos and to have all these things. But yet, to learn more about the style and stuff, I guess that the 15 years old when I'm talking to you is better to give a better result on what could be the best descriptor words and modifier words for the type of clothes someone could wear. Please describe each type of clothes from head to toe that a 15 year old will wear and the accessory like a backpack, glasses, and stuff that they will have in any kind of depiction of, you know, the youth style that is so iconic to our modern days and focusing on more modern style. I'm not personally into the denim and the jeans so Levi's can stay on the side. I realize that a lot of those brands that I like are more towards athletics and the sport. I guess that we could name even more sports brand and focus on the appearance of a 15 year old but not as trendy as that. Maybe going with the more broad spectrum that is for the four years that will precede this 19 year old age so that we are in 2023. It should be able to include trends that are the most recent and contemporary to us. So maybe the last decade and the previous one. So 2013 up to 2023 and going with the most iconic brands of sportwear and describing from head to toe the things that are on the person like maybe a belt, a watch, a baseball cap, maybe an earring, pursing, maybe, you know, braces, maybe the hoodie and then go layer by layer the things that will be seen from the outside so it does not need to go as deep as the thing we don't see. If we see the sock of the person you can give example and for those saggers maybe we can see the rim of the underwear brand I think but yeah if you can name everything that you have in the list and then later we will be able to expand the list because as you know I like to have an expansion of everything to have more idea to feed to my mid-journey helper to create my image.
User
Of course, I would like to expand because this is what we are doing right now, and it's the goal of our conversation. And this session is all about expanding lists and extending lists. So, for sure, I would like to do that. But what I would like to do is that I think that for a brand of underwear, you said Tommy and Figure, and also Calvin Klein, because they are the most classical brand, and also because other brands like AIMS and Fruit of the Loom are less obvious from the outside perspective, so I understand that they are not to be listed as obvious contenders. But I think that there are new brands, modern brands, and more contemporary brands that have been forgotten. Also, maybe going by each sport category of the youth may help us to find brands that we forgot. So, I know that many people may practice different sports or even not practice this sport, but have only the style of it. And I think that some of those sports are more in line with what we are talking about, like skateboarding and other extreme sports that are used by many people. Snowboarding brands have been also omitted. Maybe surf brands that are very known. I think brands like Thrasher, that is a magazine, but I've made a lot of t-shirts that are iconic, and things like that that could be expanded. And then those expanded items should be extended to list even more by subgroups. So, if you can imagine more subgroups than those that I explained and list more brands, and then go by countries. Maybe I know that some brands are from Germany, some brands are from the UK, some brands are from the United States, and we should also name the Korean brand that was an Italian brand. I think it's FIFA. And other brands also that are popular among young people that are not that obvious, like I know Emporio Armani is one brand, and things like that. When you go by region, you can name the brands that are from that country, but also brands that are more popular in that country, even if they come from another place. So, to be able to cover everything, you may be more large a spectrum than if it's not precise. It's not a bad thing because it will give us more topics, more words, more ideas. And this is kind of brainstorming. I want it to be expansive, expanding. I would like it to be going in an exhaustive manner, in a comprehensive manner, and I would like to list as many things as we can. So, if you add some things now and then that are not very specific to what we say, but that are related to the topic, it could be put in another category, if you have it, and then we can talk about these things later.
User
There is a different aspect of youth fashion I would like to explore next, that is, I think that to have more idea, a shock of idea could be a great thing to do for a brainstorming like we are doing and to get more topics and more words. You know, I'm aiming for vocabulary to use with mid-journey to describe in an image from what I want to have as a youth person that is iconic, classic, or modern, and have my choices to paint with words the image I want. So what I want you to do is to contrasting now. I would like to use contrast as a way to get more idea. Think of a 15-year-old teenager that is in UK or any places like England and other places in the UK and please think of a 15-year-old teenager that is in Germany and then describe each other and list the differences and list the similarities and then expand on each list such that we can get more idea of topic to explore next.
User
I will keep this list for expansion for later because I have another idea of contrasting approach to help me provide a broader spectrum of element. And remember, not just fashion element and not just cultural influences. I would like you to focus also on the vocabulary of things. Therefore, instead of comparing those two styles, I think we will compare a 19-year-old in the UK with a 19-year-old in the US so that we can gain more vocabulary. I would like this more focused on the name of things rather than brands like we did earlier, such that having those two places will give us a wider range of words because of the difference in wording that they may have. So if you can find a way to discuss all of these things, but in a way that will expand on the vocabulary. And first, before you do that, I would like you to explain what is the concept of a brainstorming. And also, I would like you before to do that to list the different ways of generating more idea when we talk about a topic with an AI like you that is based on LLM and a GPT-based model so that we can do a brainstorming that will generate even more words. Then please describe a 19-year-old in UK in the context of expanding the word list of things that they may wear. And then we will do a contrast with the 19-year-old in the US that may have the same clothes, but they will have a different name. And then list the words like clothes, apparel, and these words also that are more generic and that are about the category of topics. And then we will be able to do more contrasting session. And later we will expand them. I will go revisit each of them later. I will remind you what it was. But for now, please explain to us how to...
User
This is a very interesting approach. I'm happy that you do that for me. Now that we will go with the 19-year-old in the U.S. and now that we will identify different names for similar items, I would like you to remember to expand the vocabulary beyond what you already said. So we have topwear, bottomwear, we have outwear, footwear, accessory, and undergarment. But feel free to expand this to even more because we will have the time to explore all of these with the U.S. 19-year-old. And remember that the goal of this game today and the brainstorming we are doing is focusing on different names and having that both type of synonym that is converging to a same thing and that is expanding or diverging towards other things of the same category that could be considered a synonym in a category.
User
These descriptions are very nice, but I will keep them for later. I like when we did the German versus the UK 15-year-old. This time, I will keep also this for later. I would like to go on a different comparison. Again, we will contrast things to be able to gain more vocabulary. Now, I would like to think about someone from Spain that will be someone in between 15 and 19 years old, Spaniard or Spanish boy, and the way they will look and they will be clothed.
User
Yes, I would like to do both to delve deeper into specific aspects of this style for Spanish teenagers 15 to 19 years old, and I also want to contrast it with their other regions, which will be Mexico and Latin America. So, not only to learn Spanish words, which is a nice thing, but also in English to learn more new concepts that we didn't expand earlier. I would like to see all those Spanish teenagers compared with the Mexican teenager and the Latin American teenager. So, please expand on these comparisons to contrast both sides of the Atlantic, and then not only with the Spanish, but also the English to expand the vocabulary to more words that are not yet already mentioned, or for these words that you know we already mentioned, if you can use other synonyms and other words, both in Spanish and in English, that will expand more on the English side preferably, but that can also list a few Spanish words too.
User
Yes, thank you. This was very amazing. I would like you to do a summary of the things that we learned today, going from the top most things, and then for each of them, making lists of things that we have learned, so that we can have a summary of everything that has been said since the beginning of this session, or at least as far as you can remember. Also, anyway, if you don't have the beginning of the session, or if you remember just the last part, it does not matter, because you know we are all about expansion, and these words are to be the same as earlier words, so don't worry, you can base your lists on the more recent discussion, and everything that you have access to in the scope of the context of the current conversation. Also, please remember that I said summary, but meaning an analyst, an analytic list. I say summary, but it's not really a summary, because I want to have a big list of everything, so summary is not the correct word, because it will be limiting you. I don't want you to limit yourself. I want you to be able to do the more expanded and the more extensive list. I would like you to be able to go beyond what summary means, so I think it's not the correct word. Please do listing of each broad category, and for each of them, go deeper with words, and with brands, and with everything we learned since the beginning, or as far as you can analyze what we said.
User
I would like to find a way to layer all of these things on the same person such that you remember I want to create an image of them and I would like you to think about ways of putting stuff on top of each other, like starting from head going to toe, you know, I prefer baseball cap, I said it, I prefer hoodies, I prefer jogger pants, I prefer sneakers or espadrilles or other kind of shoes that are in the eye top, like basketball shoes and stuff like that, and I prefer bold items, I don't like things that are too baggy or too large, but I don't want something that is too fit, I would prefer something in the middle of them, and I would like you to think of words for apparel that can be stacked on top of each other, so like you can have a jacket that is open and then under which you have a hoodie but with the model with a zipper and then under that you can have a t-shirt, so that's one example, you can have a belt, some shorts with some compression pants under them or some sock and some shoes or stuff like that, and then you can see on the neck of those people some accessory like chains and other stuff that you could name, and then on the width of those people are different type of bracelets that you can name also that young people will wear with you know meanings and colors and stuff like that, and then you may have rings and stuff like that, and then you may think about an image or a picture of these people, so if it is, it would be nice to include things that may not be apparel per se but things like braces and pursing and for the 18 and 19 years old people maybe some tattoo and stuff like that that you could be able to list to make a vocabulary expansion on all of these things such that I could be able to describe my subject to mid-journey in a way that is layered and that focus on each aspect one after the other after the other, and after this please give me the order of element like I'm asking you for grammar for English what order of adjective and stuff like he is wearing green is not the proper order but then if we have a lot of those adjectives and we want to pack a lot of information it goes beyond the normal sentences that we are used to use in English and the precedence of adjectives and descriptors and modifiers will be interesting to know so if you can also explain me the order of words and gives an example with a lot of description for some same item like if the hoodie is green and the hoodie is snug or fit and then the hoodie is retro and stuff like that you would have to put all those words in a certain sequence and there is a way to order those words that is more effective in English grammar than another and I would like to have example of that.
User
Yes, I would like you to create a very long sentence that will have a lot of words in it. I would like you to give me an example for UDI, which is the centerpiece of my image. I would like you to think of the UDI as something that takes a lot of space in the image around the boys that are in the image, so that you will create a long adjective list of things. I would like you to think about nouns and other words that may go before or after UDI in a phrase, and I would like you to do it as long as possible. The goal is not to give an example of conversational language that you use in a conversation with people, and the goal is not to do something that will be in a news article or something like that. The goal is to have as many different things like the origin of the UDI and the shape, the color, and everything like that. And then I would like you to do the example also for the structured baseball cap after, and then the cotton jogger pants, and a type of sneaker, maybe like basketball shoes or something like that. I would like you to do that for each of those four. I would like you to remember to create as long as possible a sentence for me to learn the order of adjective. It will be like an example that I would like you to start with the incorrect version as the example of each, such that as you go as a large language model, you will be able to leverage your language model in no specific order to add more of these words in no order. It will help you leverage that, and then focusing on those incorrect words, you will be able to give the correct example next, such that you will just have to reorder the thing in the proper order. So I think to help you make these very, very long sentences or things like that, it could be better to give an example, like start with an UDI, give a very, very long incorrect sentence such that you can list everything in good order, but maybe if you find other elements, you can name them in another fashion, and then do the correct one for UDI baseball cap that is more structured, for the cotton jogger pants that are gray or other color, and for a type of sneaker that is maybe a top that is more like basketball shoes or things like that. Give me four examples and make it such that it will be a very long example to have each things, and if you have words that go before UDI and also after, I would like to have the list of descriptor words, nouns, adjectives, and other modifiers that should be put all together in a very long sentence. Please.
User
Do you think that there is a way to have also these words after the subject, like that sentence will have some words relating to the shoes or to the jogger pants or to the Strucker baseball cap? And I think you made a mistake, I was saying hoodie and maybe you didn't get it correctly, but the thing that have a hood on the top and like a kangaroo pouch and stuff like that, hoodie, I don't know what is a UDI, maybe you can explain it to me what is an urban digital interface, I don't have any idea what it is, but please let me know if there is a way to have words around the subject which is shoes or jogger pants or stuff like that, or if all of these must be before and there is no way to have any other additional information that comes after these elements, please.
