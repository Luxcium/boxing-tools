# Login Form Component

This component allows you to add a login form to your app. It includes fields for the user to enter their email address and password, and a submit button to log in.

## Installation

To install the login form component, run the following command:

´npm install login-form´

or

´yarn add login-form´

## Usage

To use the login form component in your app, import it and render it like this:

´import LoginForm from 'login-form';

function App() {
return (

<div>
<LoginForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
</div>
);
}´

The `onSubmit` prop is a function that is called when the user submits the form. It is passed an object with the form data, including the email and password entered by the user. You can use this function to authenticate the user and log them in.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the login form by passing props to the component. For example, you can change the label for the email field like this:

´<LoginForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} emailLabel="Email Address:" />´

You can also customize the placeholder text for the input fields:

´<LoginForm
  onSubmit={handleSubmit}
  emailLabel="Email Address:"
  emailPlaceholder="Enter your email"
  passwordPlaceholder="Enter your password"
/>´

The test file for the `LoginForm` component is used to ensure that the component is functioning correctly. It does this by simulating user interactions with the component and checking that the component behaves as expected.

To use the test file, you will need to have the `jest` testing library installed in your project. You can then run the test by typing the following command in your terminal:

´jest login-form.test.js´

The test file uses the `render` function from the `@testing-library/react` library to render the `LoginForm` component and simulate user interactions with it. It then uses the `expect` function from Jest to make assertions about the component's behavior.

For example, the test file includes a test that checks that the `LoginForm` component submits the email and password when the user clicks the submit button. It does this by simulating the user typing in the email and password inputs and clicking the submit button, and then checking that the `onSubmit` function passed to the component was called with the expected form data.

If the test passes, it means that the `LoginForm` component is working correctly. If the test fails, it means that there is a bug in the component that needs to be fixed.
