Travis is not what it was before I think it is obvious from what we can read on their plan page and with some incongruencies like that:

1. No credit card required for Free Plan!
2. Credit Card authorization with $1.00 hold required for Free Trial.

**I think they kind of betrayed the community when they said:**

_Testing your open source
projects will always be free!
Seriously. Always. We like to think of it as our way of giving
back to a community that connects so many people._
